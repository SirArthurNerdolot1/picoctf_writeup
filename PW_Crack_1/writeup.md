# PW Crack 1
## Description
Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/10/level1.py) and you'll need the encrypted [flag](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/10/level1.flag.txt.enc) in the same directory too.
## Solution
We notice that one of the file is a python file so when we open it, we get the password:``691d``
On running the file, we get:
```
‚ùØ python3 level1.py
Please enter correct password for flag: 691d
Welcome back... your flag, user:
picoCTF{545h_r1ng1ng_56891419}
```
